Язык является полностью объектно-ориентированным в том плане, что всё является объектами[25]. Необычной особенностью языка является выделение блоков кода пробельными отступами[28]. Синтаксис ядра языка минималистичен, за счёт чего на практике редко возникает необходимость обращаться к документации[27]. Сам же язык известен как интерпретируемый и используется в том числе для написания скриптов[25]. Недостатками языка являются зачастую более низкая скорость работы и более высокое потребление памяти написанных на нём программ по сравнению с аналогичным кодом, написанным на компилируемых языках, таких как C или C++[25][27].\n#Структура Python является мультипарадигменным языком программирования, поддерживающим императивное, процедурное, структурное, объектно-ориентированное программирование[25], метапрограммирование[29] и функциональное программирование[25]. Задачи обобщённого программирования решаются за счёт динамической типизации[30][31]. Аспектно-ориентированное программирование частично поддерживается через декораторы[32], более полноценная поддержка обеспечивается дополнительными фреймворками[33]. Такие методики как контрактное и логическое программирование можно реализовать с помощью библиотек или расширений[34]. Основные архитектурные черты — динамическая типизация, автоматическое управление памятью[25], полная интроспекция, механизм обработки исключений, поддержка многопоточных вычислений с глобальной блокировкой интерпретатора (GIL)[35], высокоуровневые структуры данных. Поддерживается разбиение программ на модули, которые, в свою очередь, могут объединяться в пакеты.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://example.com/project/example/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Example Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://example.com/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Cristina Espinosa","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
